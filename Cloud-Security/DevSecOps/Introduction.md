### Story of DevOps

* Waterfall model used to be the standard approach to development. Bugs and security flaws were backlogged which was messy and not scalable.
* Agile model followed which made times more organised, giving time to focus on clients and leaving room for flexibility.
* DevOps was created in 2008 which increases efficiency by implementing cross-integration across all departments of development. 
* Changes pushed out are reversible and visible to all teams involved, ensuring better communication and contribution to delivering work.
* Cloud plays a big part in providing resources without depending on IT infrastructure and allowing for Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
* It emphasises in building trust.



### How does DevOps work? 

Its an infinite loop made up of different phases. 



* CI/CD : Deals with merging code and adding tested in an automated way to perform checks and ensure that bugs are detected when code is pushed and merged.
* Infrastructure As Code (IAC): Reuse of code to deploy infrastructure (cloud instances) helping to keep resources consistent. Tools used are terraform, vagrant, etc.
* Config Management: Infrastructure state is constantly managed to apply changes efficiently and ensure it is more maintainable. 
* Orchestration: The automation of workflows which allows for fast responses during issues due to monitoring. 
* Monitoring: Collecting data on the performance of services and infrastructure to enable faster recovery provide better analyse on the cause.
* Microservices: Breaks a big app into mini smaller apps to increases scalability and reduce complexity.



### Shifting Left

Security used to be added at the end of development. Now it is implemented during all stages which ensures flaws are caught early, reducing costs, building trust, and ultimately improving the security. 



This development approach is known as DevSecOps.



### DevSecOps Challenges

* Security Silos: Security teams can be kept out of the development process which prevents engineers from understanding the necessity of security from the beginning. It is best practice to share this responsibility instead of having a specialised security engineer.
* Lack of visibility: Trust should be built between teams to ensure that security is treated as a regular aspect of the application.
* Stringent Processes: Developers need sandbox environments to test new software without common security limitations. Each piece of software should not go through a complicated process against security compliance before being used by developers. 



### DevSecOps Culture

* Autonomy of teams: Processes should be automated where they fit within the development pipeline to allow security to become a regular test, like unit testing.
* Visibility: For every tool being introduced, their should be a process to provide this visibility to other teams so that tasks don't get lost in the backlog and flaws can be tackled at the right time.
* Flexibility:
